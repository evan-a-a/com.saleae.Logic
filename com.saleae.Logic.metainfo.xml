    <p>NOTE: This application is not useful on its own and requires the purchase of Saleae Logic Analyzer hardware.</p>
    <p>Effortlessly decode protocols like SPI, I2C, Serial, and many more. Leverage community created analyzers or build your own low-level or high-level protocol analyzer.</p>
    <p>Debugging that just works. Stable, easy to use, and fully cross platform, Logic 2 makes it dirt simple to capture, visualize, and search your signals.</p>
    <p>Explore your board-level comms interactively with Live Trigger on Protocol and Protocol Search. Unlike a scope, all your traffic is being recorded — you can always stop and analyze exactly what happened and why.</p>
    <p>Verify behavior instantly with measurements wherever you point your mouse. You can even create your own measurements or use ones from the community.</p>
    <p>Take on any comms challenge by creating your own low-level protocol analyzer, high-level protocol analyzer, or measurement. And if you like, you can easily share your extension with the Saleae community.</p>

    <release version="2.4.13" date="2023-11-28">
      <description>
        <p>Welcome to the 2.4.13 release of Logic! This release contains a lot of changes under the hood, especially to how we save and load files.</p>
        <p>Older files will load just fine, but files saved with 2.4.13 will not load into older versions of Logic.</p>
        <p>If you run into any troubles with the release, please be sure to let us know.</p>
        <p>Also, thanks to many of you for the feedback on the UI changes in the last release! We’re reviewing that now and I expect to incorporate some of the feedback in the next release.</p>
        <p>What's New</p>
	<ul>
          <l>Added support for the latest Logic Pro 8 hardware revision. This new revision use a slightly different FPGA part number, due to supply chain issues from last year.</l>
        </ul>
        <p>Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul>
          <l>Fixed the Linux 4GB memory limit. We are now using a custom build of Electron on that platform to solve the issue.</l>
          <l>Fixed the crash when changing the IO voltage level on the original Logic 16.</l>
          <l>Fixed the crash on Linux when opening the software with a device already attached.</l>
        </ul>
